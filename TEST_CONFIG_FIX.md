# Testing Dynamic Config Creation

## Test Changes
- Testing fixed authentication in CI/CD
- Creating .databrickscfg dynamically in GitHub Actions
- This should work without config file errors

## What This Tests
- ✅ CI validation on pull request
- ✅ Dynamic .databrickscfg file creation
- ✅ Project structure validation
- ✅ Automatic deployment to dev on merge

## Expected Results
- CI should run without authentication errors
- All checks should pass ✅
- Ready for merge and automatic deployment to dev

## Technical Details
The workflow now creates the Databricks config file dynamically:
```yaml
- name: Configure Databricks CLI
  run: |
    mkdir -p ~/.databricks
    cat > ~/.databrickscfg << EOF
    [DEFAULT]
    host = ${{ secrets.DATABRICKS_HOST }}
    token = ${{ secrets.DATABRICKS_TOKEN }}
    EOF
    chmod 600 ~/.databrickscfg
```

This ensures the CLI has the config file it expects, populated with secrets from GitHub.
