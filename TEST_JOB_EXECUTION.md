# Testing Job Execution in CI

## Test Changes
- Enhanced CI to actually run the Databricks job
- CI now deploys to dev and executes the job
- Waits for job completion and validates success

## What This Tests
- ✅ CI validation on pull request
- ✅ Deploy bundle to dev environment
- ✅ **Run the actual Databricks job**
- ✅ **Wait for job completion**
- ✅ **Validate job success**
- ✅ Automatic deployment to dev on merge

## New CI Workflow

### On Pull Request:
1. **Validate** - Check bundle configuration
2. **Test on Dev** - Deploy and run job on dev
   - Deploy bundle to dev
   - Trigger the job
   - Wait for completion (up to 10 minutes)
   - Validate job succeeded
3. **Only merge if tests pass**

### On Merge to Main:
1. **Validate** - Check bundle configuration
2. **Deploy to Dev** - Automatic deployment

## Expected Results
- CI now tests the actual job execution
- PR can only be merged if job runs successfully
- All checks should pass ✅
- Ready for merge and automatic deployment to dev

## Technical Details
The workflow now includes a `test-on-dev` job that:
```yaml
- Deploys the bundle to dev
- Runs the job using `databricks bundle run` or `databricks jobs run-now`
- Polls for job completion
- Validates the job succeeded before allowing merge
```

This ensures that code changes are actually tested on Databricks before merging!
